# carwow/rubydoc: A rubydoc.info server for rubydoc

This is a fork of [docmeta/rubydoc.info](https://github.com/docmeta/rubydoc.info)
used internally @carwow to allow developers to view ruby documentation for private
gems.

Many thanks to the creators Loren Segal (YARD) and Nick Plante (rdoc.info) for
their work, and the many [contributors](https://github.com/docmeta/rubydoc.info/graphs/contributors).

## Getting Started

For carwow devs, you can start this server with `carwow start rubydoc`.

The docserver will be available at `https://rubydoc.carwow.local`
